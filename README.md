# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

This project demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. It covers all stages of the ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Collect and load data from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using popular frameworks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for inference.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
